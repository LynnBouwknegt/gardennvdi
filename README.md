# GardenNDVI

A project to process aerial infrared images to calculate NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) per private yard. 

## Prerequisites

1. **Python 3.7+** (Make sure Python is on your `PATH`).
2. **Git** (optional, but generally recommended if you are cloning this repository).
3. **Pixi** installed (see [Installation(Windows)] below).https://github.com/LynnBouwknegt/gardennvdi.git
4. **Jupyter Notebook** (optional, but recommended for data exploration). Required to run `analysis.ipynb`

This project uses **Pixi** to manage Python virtual environments.
**Pixi** makes it easy to isolate project dependencies, ensuring reproducible installations and clean development environments.

## Installation (Windows)

Follow these steps to install **Pixi** on Windows:

1. **Check your Python version**  
   Open PowerShell or Command Prompt and run:
   ```sh
   python --version
   ```
2. **Install Pixi**

    On PowerShell, run:
    ```sh
    powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm -useb https://pixi.sh/install.ps1 | iex"
    ```
3. **Pull Project from Github**
    Pull the project from Github:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/LynnBouwknegt/gardennvdi.git
    ```
    Or download the project as a zip file and extract it.
4. **Initiate project with Pixi**
    Go to your project directory:
    ```sh
    cd path/to/your/project
    ```
    And run:
    ```sh
    pixi install
    ```

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

* `src/` contains all the source code for the project.
    * `ndvi.py` Main script to calculate NDVI and process both data and images.
    * `api/` All external API calls handled here.
        * `bgt_api.py` API calls to BGT API.
        * `kadaaster_api.py` API calls to Kadaster API.
* `analysis.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook for data analysis.
* `pixi.toml` Human-readable Pixi file which states the project's dependencies.
* `pixi.lock` Lock file generated by Pixi to ensure reproducible installations.
* `/kadaaster_data` Folder that stores download kadaaster file.

## Use Guide

Refer to the `analysis.ipynb` for examples on how to run the code.
